<b>Background</b>
Pleasecycle is a small, growing tech start-up business, providing tools to organisations to help their staff start cycling more, thereby reducing carbon and also cutting down sick-days through employee engagement. Due to their size and growth curve Pleasecycle were looking for an Account Manager to join their team in London.<br>
<b>What had they tried?</b>
Pleasecycle had already tried advertising on LinkedIn, but had found no success through that means, and were keen to look at a more proactive and niche approach, which they felt The Sales Floor could offer.<br>
<b>What We Provided</b>
The Sales Floor set up Pleasecycle with Logins within 10 minutes of the initial phone call. Due to their small size Pleasecycle also asked whether The Sales Floor could manage the entire process; uploading the vacancy to the site, filtering applications etc., and we duly obliged. Once the vacancy was uploaded, Pleasecycle’s vacancy was posted across LinkedIn, LinkedIn Groups, our own groups, and Twitter 5-10 times a day. We also provided them a shortlist of individuals from our network to contact should they see fit.<br>
<b>The Result</b>
Within a week the soon-to-be successful candidate applied to the role, found through our social media campaign. Pleasecycle have since taken him on board.<br>
<b>What they had to say</b>
“We started working with The Sales Floor team not long after their launch, and found them personal, professional and very different to other job board offerings out there.<br>
For a start they actually are a Sales Specialist board- helping us focus on some of the key criteria we looked for in a sales person.<br>
Despite their size and early days, we found a relevant application within 5 days with 1 in 3 applications being relevant to our role.<br>
One of the relevant applications turned into a success for us, which we were incredibly pleased with given The Sales Floor’s early days as a job board.<br>
However we found them easy to use, always there when we needed them, and we wouldn’t hesitate to call upon them for our next sales requirement.”<br>

<b>Background</b>

FOUR magazine is part of a growing publishing house in London. They are a food magazine, 

with high standards, and they also sell advertising space to high-end luxury brands. They 

had a growing requirement for high volumes of sales executives in their London office. <br>

<b>What had they tried?</b>

FOUR had previously tried using recruitment agencies, but had found them poor at 

delivering the right calibre of candidate, and too expensive given they were dealing with 

junior hires. They wanted an option that would be more cost effective. <br>

<b>What We Provided</b>

Within an hour of our initial discussion we had FOUR set up on the site, and their vacancy 

posted across our social media platforms; LinkedIn, LinkedIn groups, our own groups, and 

Twitter. We provided a shortlist of hand-picked profiles from people in our LinkedIn network 

for them to contact, which they duly did. <br>

<b>The Result</b>

Within a few days 4-5 suitable candidates had applied, and were invited to interview. One 

was hired after their first interview, with a further 3 kept in the process for additional 

headcount they had, meaning a possibility of 4 hires from just one advert. <br>

<b>What they had to say</b>

“I initially contacted The Sales Floor to help us with an urgent need for a quick hire, I was 

very impressed with the results

Within hours I had been provided with a substantial list of potential target candidates. On top 

of that the responses from our placed advertisement were almost all suitable for the role, 

with all but one being called for interview. All of the candidates were of high calibre and we 

ended up hiring one on the spot.

We managed to fill our role within two weeks from introduction to The Sales Floor to the 

applicant accepting the position.<br>

Professional, reliable and very affordable”<br>

<b>Background</b>

ESI International, part of the Informa Group, is a world renowned provider of Training 

solutions in the corporate world. Their Project Management courses are used by over 35% 

of the world’s largest companies, in over 100 countries. ESI had a requirement in the UK for 

a Business Development Manager to win new business in that region. <br>

<b>What had they tried?</b>

ESI tried a number of traditional methods, as well as solutions such as LinkedIn posts, and 

adverts, along with their recruiter license. However they found they were not receiving the 

right applications, and needed a solution that was going to give wider reach, and cover all 

avenues. <br>

<b>What We Provided</b>

The Sales Floor had ESI International up and running within hours, ensuring their role went 

live immediately, and then set about setting up traditional campaigns, but also social media 

campaigns for their vacancy. Crucially, within 24 hours The Sales Floor returned a list of 

potential ‘passive’ candidates to ESI, for them to reach out to directly. <br>

<b>The Result</b>

The Sales Floor provided a steady stream of active candidates through the application 

process, and from the various campaigns set up on the likes of Indeed.com, and 

Adzuna.co.uk, as well as their Partner network of over 100 other job boards, however ESI 

eventually hired someone from the list of ‘passive’ candidates sent by The Sales Floor, 

saving them costly agency fee’s, and ensuring they were able to reach out to the strongest, 

most desirable candidates on the market. <br>

<b>What they had to say</b>

“We decided to partner with The Sales Floor for a UK Sales requirement we had early in 

2014. We found them straightforward, incredibly helpful, and quick to respond when we 

needed them. They combine traditional job board methods with some great unique services, 

and it was from these additional services that we actually ended up hiring someone. We’d 

recommend them to anyone else looking for a new approach to finding sales people, and 

look forward to working with them in the future. “<br>

    <div class="clear"></div>
    <b>Background</b>

    British Gas have a cyclical pattern of high levels of recruitment throughout the year, which see them 

    needing to run high volume campaigns across the country on a regular basis. Using recruitment 

    agencies would ultimately prove too costly for the volumes they have to deal with, and therefore direct 

    advertising is usually their preferred option. <br>

    <b>What had they tried?</b>

    British Gas have used many forms of advertising in the past; LinkedIn, as well as most job boards in 

    the generalist and specialist space, however they have never found much success with other niche 

    sales boards, and the generalist boards were not performing for their sales requirements, and hence 

    they needed to try something new. <br>

    <b>What We Provided</b>

    The Sales Floor provided British Gas with a branded campaign, including multiple roles advertised 

    across the country, ranging from low-level, high volume hires to more senior professional hires. British 

    Gas were set up with tailored, targeted campaigns across Google, Indeed.com and Adzuna, ensuring 

    a high level of traffic to the volume roles they needed to fill. For the professional hires, The Sales 

    Floor set up social media campaigns, run across LinkedIn and Twitter, targeting a more senior, 

    passive audience, as well as providing shortlists of passive candidates from our own networks for 

    British Gas to reach out to. <br>

    <b>The Result</b>

    Within 3 weeks of running the campaign over the Christmas period, British Gas had received on 

    average 200 applications per week to their jobs. They set up numerous interviews across all their 

    roles, and have so far hired 3 candidates, with more in the interview process still being considered 

    too. <br>

    <b>What they had to say</b>

    “Our relationship with The Sales Floor has so far resulted in us hiring three candidates into call centre 

    and field sales roles. 

    We are also still considering candidates for a couple of senior sales roles, so there may be more 

    success to follow! <br>

    The team were extremely helpful from day one, and have worked hard behind the scenes to generate 

    interest in our roles from a relevant candidate audience. 

    If you are looking for a new sales specific job board, then The Sales Floor is a great new addition to 

    the marketplace.”<br>

<b>Background</b>
Paymentsense is a leader in the Financial Services and Merchant Provider space. They have clients all over the UK both big and small, and their sales team is heavily field based. They traditionally used to use recruitment agencies, but the volume of recruitment they have gone through in the past year has meant they needed to focus on reducing their cost-per-hire.
<br>
<b>What had they tried?</b>
Paymentsense already used a number of other job boards to start fulfilling their requirements, which was working well enough for them, but they were still looking to increase their volume of hires on a monthly basis, and also wanted to improve their brand awareness across social media.
<br>
 
<b>What we provided</b>
<br>
The Sales Floor provides regular monthly campaigns across the likes of Indeed.com, Facebook and our partner network of job boards to ensure a strong volume of applications to their field sales positions. We set up targeted, branded adverts across specific locations on the likes of Facebook and LinkedIn, which attracts a different calibre of candidate to the more traditional job board, and helps Paymentsense increase their brand awareness at the same time.
 <br>
<b>The Result</b>
Since 2014 Paymentsense have hired multiple Field Sales Executives every single month off The Sales Floor. They have steadily increased their volume of posts each month since first being introduced and are now working with us to further increase their volume of hires into 2015.
 <br>
 
<b>What they had to say</b>
“We’ve been using The Sales Floor since 2014 and their job adverts consistently turn in to hires for us. They’ve helped us reduce our cost-per-hire and I highly recommend them to anyone looking to advertise for sales people”

<b>Background</b>
Journeycall, part of the ESP Group is a contact centre expert in the travel and smartcard industries. Given their expertise within this space, when they do hire, they look for very specific skills and experience with regards to which markets candidates have sold into; namely transportation and rail. They enlisted the help of The Sales Floor in 2014 looking to hire a Business Development Manager.
<br>
<b>What had they tried?</b>
Journeycall had tried posting an advert on LinkedIn, with very little success, as well as trying to fill their role via usual methods, however they found that there weren’t receiving the right quality of candidates for the role in question. They needed a more proactive, targeted approach to finding applicants.
<br>
 
<b>What we provided</b>
<br>
Under our Gold Package, Journeycall received a branded advert on The Sales Floor’s own platform, as well as distribution of their job to other key job boards and aggregators in the UK. Within 24 hours, The Sales Floor carried out their proactive sourcing service for Journeycall, returning between 25-30 candidates from social media, hand-picked by our team, for Journeycall to reach out to and engage with directly. We also provided targeted advertising across LinkedIn- Setting up a branded advert only to be shown to Sales people, within London, who had sold into transportation and rail.
 <br>
<b>The Result</b>
Within a few weeks, Journeycall had contact all the candidates provided via the proactive sourcing service, and off the back of that, had set up a number of interviews. One candidate was successful in being offered the role, and started soon afterwards, saving Journeycall thousands of pounds in recruitment fees.

 <br>
 
<b>What they had to say</b>
“We used The Sales Floor for the first time after struggling to find someone through our usual channels, and it proved immensely effective. Their targeted focus on Social Media provided us with a selection of high calibre candidates and more importantly, their proactive sourcing service proved the ultimate difference, with us hiring one of the people they found for us, soon after our campaign went live. A highly proactive, and cost effective alternative to traditional agencies and job boards!  I would definitely use The Sales Floor again in the future.”
